    "summary": "This project provides a framework for creating, managing, and running microservices in a distributed environment. It features a MicroserviceHandler class that handles the lifecycle of microservices, including starting, stopping, and configuration updates. The framework also includes a ConfigurationHandler for fetching and managing configurations from a REST API, and an IOHandler for managing input and output communication with other services. With this framework, developers can easily create scalable and maintainable microservices while abstracting away common functionalities such as logging, configuration management, and input/output handling.",
